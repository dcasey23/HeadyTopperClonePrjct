MY COUSIN VINNY IPA
// this is the one I brought into the office. A great base, this recipe is right in the profile. For an extract version I think this is close. I plan on adjusting the hops to boost the profile... it is also just shy on the bitterness.

1) Sanitize your fermenter (either a carboy, stopper and blow-off tubing or plastic bucket, lid and 
airlock) with a no-rinse cleanser or other properly-diluted sanitizing chemical. 
8 oz Crystal 40L, 8 oz Dextrin Malt, 8 oz.US 2 row 
2) Steep grains in 2 – 2½ gallons of water in your brew pot at 155°F for 10-15 minutes. Remove 
and rinse. 
6.6# Light LME, 1# Wheat DME, 1# Corn Sugar 
3) Bring brew pot to boil. Remove from heat. Add malt extract (and any other sugars and/or water 
treatments, but do not add your priming/bottling sugar). Stir until everything has dissolved. 
Return to heat. 
4) Boil above ingredients (wort) for a total of one hour. Add hops throughout the boil as indicated. 
5) Turn off heat. In order to help cool down the wort, take your brew pot off the stove and cover it 
to avoid splashing. Immerse it in a sink partially filled with ice-water and swirl the pot 
occasionally. Chill until the bottom of the pot is cool to the touch when removed from the ice 
water bath. 
6) Fill your sanitized fermenter with approximately 2 gallons of room temperature water. It is 
important that you add the water to the fermenter first when using a glass carboy since the glass can crack when 
subjected to extreme temperature changes. 
7) Splash the wort into the fermenter while straining out the hop trub. Splashing will help dissolve some air into the wort. 
Top up to 5 gallons with room temperature water. 
8) Immediately add (pitch) your yeast when the wort is at or below 78F (when the fermenter no longer feels warm to the 
touch). 
9) If using a carboy, attach stopper and blow-off tubing and run the other end into water in a container to collect excess 
foam (blow-off). Make sure stopper is dry so that it creates a firm seal in the neck of the carboy. After blow-off has 
subsided (24-48 hours.) replace tubing with a sanitized airlock 1/2 full of water. If fermenting in a plastic bucket, attach 
lid and airlock 1/2 full of water. 
We recommend Fermentis US-05 dry yeast. 
For liquid yeast, try White Labs 001 or Wyeast 1056. 
10) Ferment in a dark place. Fermentation should start within 48 hours and finish within 3-10 days or up to 50 days at colder 
temperatures (Ale yeast is best used between 63F-75F. Lager yeast is best used at 42F-58F). We recommend a total of 
two weeks to ferment an ale and six for a lager. 
11) You need to dry hop this beer by adding the following hops to you fermenter after fermentation has ended (3-7 days). 
1 oz each of Centennial, Columbus, & Simcoe
12) To be sure fermentation is complete siphon off enough beer to fill your hydrometer flask and float your hydrometer in it. A
specific gravity higher than the range above indicates incomplete fermentation. The beer is not safe to bottle. 
13) Sanitize your siphon, bottles and bottling bucket as indicated in step #1 above. Be sure to sanitize your caps! 
14) Boil (priming sugar) in one cup of water for 5 minutes and splash into your bottling bucket. 
3/4 cup (5 oz) priming sugar or 1 1/4 cups (8 oz) of DME 
15) Siphon beer from fermenter to bottling bucket. Avoid taking up yeast from fermenter and splashing beer in bottling 
bucket. Gently stir with the end of the siphon tube to mix in the priming sugar. 
16) Fill bottles from spigot, leaving 1/2" to 1" airspace and cap. A bottle filler does this best. 
17) Store bottles upright in dark place at fermentation temperature for at least two weeks. 
18) Drink the beer. Repeat.
1¾ oz each Warrior & Chinook pellets(49 AAU) bittering hop for full hour.
1 oz Simcoe pellets (13 AAU) bittering hop for last 45 min of boil.
1 oz Centennial pellets (10 AAU) flavoring hop for last 30 min of boil. 
½ tsp Irish moss last 15 min of boil.
1½ oz each Columbus & Simcoe pellets aroma hops for last 5 minutes.
